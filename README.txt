Node.js & Express Role-Based Authorization
This tutorial demonstrates how to set up role-based access control (RBAC) in a Node.js application with Express to secure APIs and manage permissions effectively.
Key Features
•	Roles and Permissions: Define roles (e.g., admin, user) and assign appropriate permissions.
•	JWT Authentication: Authenticate users and include role information in the JWT payload.
•	Authorization Middleware: Build reusable middleware to verify user roles and restrict route access.
•	Route Protection: Apply role-based middleware to secure specific endpoints.

Here’s how the project is structured using the provided folder organization and the details from the index.js file:
Project Structure
1. config/
•	Purpose: Holds configuration-related files.
•	Example: dbConnect.js connects to the database, ensuring a modular setup for database interactions.
•	Usage in index.js: dbConnect is imported and called to establish the database connection.
2. controllers/
•	Purpose: Contains logic for handling requests and responses.
•	Example: Authentication-related logic might be in authController.js, while user management logic is in userController.js.
3. middlewares/
•	Purpose: Stores reusable middleware functions like role verification or authentication.
•	Example: Middleware for role-based access control (authorizeRoles) or JWT token validation.
4. models/
•	Purpose: Includes schema definitions for database models.
•	Example: User.js defines the structure for user data (e.g., username, email, role).
5. routes/
•	Purpose: Defines route handlers and links them to controllers.
•	Files in Use: 
o	authRoutes.js: Handles authentication routes (/api/auth).
o	userRoutes.js: Manages user-related routes (/api/users).
6. index.js
•	The entry point of the application. It: 
o	Configures the server using Express.
o	Loads middleware like express.json() for parsing JSON payloads.
o	Maps routes (authRoutes and userRoutes) to their respective paths.
o	Starts the server on the specified port.
Example Workflow
1.	User Signs Up:
o	Request hits /api/auth route.
o	Routed to authController.js via authRoutes.js.
o	User data is validated and saved using User.js.
2.	Access-Control Middleware:
o	Middleware in middlewares/authorizeRoles.js verifies the user's role before granting access to certain routes.
This modular structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.
